This is my first full-stack project.
There are less functionalities in this and some minor changes which I will do in future as the main purpose of this project was to learn how to structure a website and store data.
I have used vigenere cipher for encrypting the dynamic urls.
There are 2 parts to this project: User and Admin.

User: 
A user can signup, login and look for financial advisors in his city. He can also book an appointment using this.

Admin:
An admin can signup to list himself to the users , can login and view his appointments.
